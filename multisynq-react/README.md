# Multisynq-React Docs

The actual docs are in the croquet-react repo now: https://github.com/croquet/croquet-react/

This repo has the doc generator and theme. It expects `croquet-react` to be checked out next to `croquet-docs`.


    ├── croquet-react
    │   └── docs
    │
    └── croquet-docs

If that's in place, you can build the react docs like any other using `npm run build` or `npm run watch` in this directory.
