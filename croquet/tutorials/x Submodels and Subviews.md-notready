We need to have a tutorial for creating and managing submodels and subviews

## A surprise

| time | 1st User RootModel | 1st User RootView | 1st User ChildModel | 1st User ChildView |
|------| -----------------|-----------------|------------------|-----------------|
| 0 | `init {`<br>`Child.create`<br>`publish "child-added"`<br>`}` | <br><br>(not subscribed yet) | <br>`init { x = 42 }`
|   |                                            | `constructor{`<br>`subscribe "child-added"`<br>`}`
| 1 | tick                 |
|   |                      |  receive `child-added`
