# Croquet Docs

The actual docs are in the `croquet` repo: https://github.com/croquet/croquet/

This repo has the doc generator and theme. It expects `croquet` to be checked out next to `croquet-docs`.


    ├── croquet
    │   └── docs
    │
    └── croquet-docs
        └── croquet     (this directory)

If that's in place, you can build the croquet docs like any other using `npm run build` or `npm run watch` in this directory.
