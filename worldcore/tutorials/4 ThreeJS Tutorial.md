This is the fourth in a series of tutorials illustrating how to build a Worldcore app. It assumes that you have familiarity with the basics of the Croquet SDK, and understand the general concepts behind Worldcore. For more inforamation, see croquet.io/docs/croquet and croquet.io/docs/worldcore.

**This tutorial shows how to use THREE.js as your renderer, and how to create a first-person avatar that is driven by mouselook.**

*(Note that because this tutorial assumes the existence of a mouse for navigation control, it won't be fully functional on a touch device.)*

The tutorials for the `@croquet/worldcore` package makes use of CodeSandbox to show a whole project for each example, with the same structure as your own project would have locally. The bundler used for this CodeSandBox is `parcel`, but `@croquet/worldcore` is bundler-agnostic.

*sandbox here*

The player actor is extended with the `MouselookAvatar` mixin. It's similar to the regular Avatar mixin, but with some added functionality for controlling a first-person character.

Specifically it breaks rotation into a pitch and a yaw component. Only the yaw is used to determine the facing of the avatar, but both are combined to determine the look vector of the camera. This creates an avatar whose motion is confined to a 2d plane, but who can also look up and down.
```
class MyAvatar extends mix(Actor).with(AM_MouselookAvatar, AM_Player) {

    get pawn() {return AvatarPawn}
    get color() {return this._color || [1,1,1,1]}

}
MyAvatar.register('MyAvatar');
```
The player pawn is aldo extended with the `MouselookAvatar` mixin. Instead of controlling the avatar's facing with `setSpin()` as we did in the previous tutorial, we use `LookTo()`, which takes pitch and yaw values derived from the mouse position. Specifically, we use `ThrottledLookTo()` which
limits how often messages are sent to the reflector. This is important because pointer events are generated very rapidly, and without throttling them we could flood the reflector with tiny incremental facing changes.

We only subscribe to mouse events when we're in pointer lock mode. This is a special browser mode that hides the cursor and stops reporting absolute cursor position. It's a better choice when you're using the mouse to drive the camera directly.

We also subscribe to a variety of events that will move the avatar forward and back, and side to to side. We track opposing movements separately so that we properly respond to competing inputs. (Pressing the forward and back arrows simultaneously, for example.)

The pawn also is extended with the `ThreeVisible` and `ThreeCamera` mixins. The ThreeVisible mixin allows us to attach a Three.js object to the pawn to be rendered by the Three.js renderer. The mixin automatically updates the render object with the pawn's global transform. The ThreeCamera mixin uses uses the pawn's position to control the Three.js camera, so our view will change as the pawn moves.
```
class AvatarPawn extends mix(Pawn).with(PM_MouselookAvatar, PM_Player, PM_ThreeVisible, PM_ThreeCamera) {

    constructor(...args) {
        super(...args);

        this.fore = this.back = this.left = this.right = 0;

        this.geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry( 1, 1, 1 );
        this.material = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial({color: new THREE.Color(...this.actor.color)});
        const cube = new THREE.Mesh( this.geometry, this.material );
        this.setRenderObject(cube);

        if (this.isMyPlayerPawn) {
            this.subscribe("input", "pointerLock", this.onPointerLock);
            this.subscribe("input", "wDown", () => {this.fore = 1; this.changeVelocity()});
            this.subscribe("input", "wUp", () => {this.fore = 0; this.changeVelocity()});
            this.subscribe("input", "sDown", () => {this.back = 1; this.changeVelocity()});
            this.subscribe("input", "sUp", () => {this.back = 0; this.changeVelocity()});
            this.subscribe("input", "aDown", () => {this.left = 1; this.changeVelocity()});
            this.subscribe("input", "aUp", () => {this.left = 0; this.changeVelocity()});
            this.subscribe("input", "dDown", () => {this.right = 1; this.changeVelocity()});
            this.subscribe("input", "dUp", () => {this.right = 0; this.changeVelocity()});

            this.subscribe("input", "ArrowUpDown", () => {this.fore = 1; this.changeVelocity()});
            this.subscribe("input", "ArrowUpUp", () => {this.fore = 0; this.changeVelocity()});
            this.subscribe("input", "ArrowDownDown", () => {this.back = 1; this.changeVelocity()});
            this.subscribe("input", "ArrowDownUp", () => {this.back = 0; this.changeVelocity()});
            this.subscribe("input", "ArrowLeftDown", () => {this.left = 1; this.changeVelocity()});
            this.subscribe("input", "ArrowLeftUp", () => {this.left = 0; this.changeVelocity()});
            this.subscribe("input", "ArrowRightDown", () => {this.right = 1; this.changeVelocity()});
            this.subscribe("input", "ArrowRightUp", () => {this.right = 0; this.changeVelocity()});
        }
    }

    destroy() {
        super.destroy();
        this.geometry.dispose();
        this.material.dispose();
    }

    onPointerLock(inPointerLock) {
        if (inPointerLock) {
            this.subscribe("input", "pointerDelta", this.onPointerDelta);
        } else {
            this.unsubscribe("input", "pointerDelta");
        }
    }

    // The multipliers here determine how fast the player moves and turns.

    changeVelocity() {
        const velocity = [ -0.01 * (this.left - this.right), 0,  -0.01 * (this.fore - this.back)]
        this.setVelocity(velocity);
    }

    onPointerDelta(data) {
        const pitch = Math.max(-Math.PI, Math.min(Math.PI, this.lookPitch + data.xy[1] * -0.0025));
        const yaw = this.lookYaw + data.xy[0] * -0.0025;
        this.throttledLookTo(pitch, yaw);
    }

}
```
The `LevelActor` could hold simulation code. But in this case it just exists to spawn the level pawn with its scenery and lighting.
```
class LevelActor extends mix(Actor).with(AM_Spatial) {
    get pawn() {return LevelPawn}
}
LevelActor.register('LevelActor');
```
The `LevelPawn` holds all the static scenery and lighting for the scene. All of these Three.js objects are grouped together as one render object. Worldcore does not automatically dispose of Three.js objects that you're done with. This is
because your application may share geometry or materials between different pawns. If you use Three.js in Worldcore, you are responsible for disposing of unused assets yourself. For example, the level pawn disposes of its geometries and materials in its `destroy()` method.
```
class LevelPawn extends mix(Pawn).with(PM_Spatial, PM_ThreeVisible) {
    constructor(...args) {
        super(...args);

        const group = new THREE.Group();

        this.floorGeometry = new THREE.PlaneGeometry(60, 60);
        this.floorMaterial = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial( {color: 0x145A32 } );
        const floor = new THREE.Mesh( this.floorGeometry, this.floorMaterial );
        floor.rotation.set(-Math.PI/2, 0, 0);
        floor.position.set(0,-0.5, 0);
        group.add(floor);

        this.pillarGeometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry( 1, 5, 1 );
        this.pillarMaterial = new THREE.MeshStandardMaterial( {color: 0x784212 } );
        const pillar0 = new THREE.Mesh( this.pillarGeometry, this.pillarMaterial );
        group.add(pillar0);
        pillar0.position.set(29.5, 2, -29.5);
        const pillar1 = new THREE.Mesh( this.pillarGeometry, this.pillarMaterial );
        pillar1.position.set(-29.5, 2, -29.5);
        group.add(pillar1);
        const pillar2 = new THREE.Mesh( this.pillarGeometry, this.pillarMaterial );
        pillar2.position.set(29.5, 2, 29.5);
        group.add(pillar2);
        const pillar3 = new THREE.Mesh( this.pillarGeometry, this.pillarMaterial );
        pillar3.position.set(-29.5, 2, 29.5);
        group.add(pillar3);

        const ambient = new THREE.AmbientLight( 0xffffff, 0.85 );
        group.add(ambient);

        const sun = new THREE.DirectionalLight( 0xffffff, 0.85 );
        sun.position.set(1000, 1000, 1000);
        group.add(sun);

        this.setRenderObject(group);
    }

    destroy() {
        super.destroy();
        this.floorGeometry.dispose();
        this.floorMaterial.dispose();
        this.pillarGeometry.dispose();
        this.pillarMaterial.dispose();
    }
}
```
When a new player avatar is spawned, it's assigned a random color and given an initial facing of 45 degrees. Note that we don't set the avatar's rotation directly, since its rotation is derived from its pitch and its yaw.
```
class MyPlayerManager extends PlayerManager {

    createPlayer(options) {
        options.lookYaw = toRad(45);
        options.color = [Math.random(), Math.random(), Math.random(), 1];
        return MyAvatar.create(options);
    }

}
MyPlayerManager.register("MyPlayerManager");
```
The `ModelRoot` spawns the static level at start-up. The player manager then spawns avatars into the level as new users join.
```
class MyModelRoot extends ModelRoot {

    static modelServices() {
        return [MyPlayerManager];
    }

    init(...args) {
        super.init(...args);
        this.level = LevelActor.create();
    }

}
MyModelRoot.register("MyModelRoot");
```
The THREE.js renderer is started by the `ThreeRenderManager`. The render manager creates the canvas that the renderer renders into, as well as the default scene that all the render objects occupy. If you want to change the render settings, you can access the Three.js renderer directly. For example, here we set the background to be blue.

The render manager also performs some simple maintenance tasks like resizing the render canvas if the window changes size.

The ViewRoot listens for the user clicking in the window. The browser will only let us enter pointerlock mode as the result of a direct user action, so we use the click event to request pointer lock from the input manager. Entering pointer lock publishes another message that we listen for in the `AvatarPawn` to subscribe to the mouse events that control the avatar's facing.

```
class MyViewRoot extends ViewRoot {

    static viewServices() {
        return [InputManager, ThreeRenderManager];
    }

    constructor(model) {
        super(model);
        const three = this.service("ThreeRenderManager");
        three.renderer.setClearColor(new THREE.Color(0.45, 0.8, 0.8));
        this.subscribe("input", "click", () => {this.service("InputManager").enterPointerLock()});
    }

}
```
Croquet defaults to 20 heartbeat ticks per second. However, since first-person avatars are particularly sensitive to sluggish simulation, you might find that increasing the tps of the session makes it feel more responsive.
