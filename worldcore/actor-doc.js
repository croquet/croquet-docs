/**
 An actor is a type of model that automatically instantiates a pawn in the view when itâ€™s created. This actor/pawn pair has a private communication channel that allows them to talk directly with each other. The actor handles the simulation, and the pawn handles input and output. When the actor is destroyed, the pawn is destroyed.


 @example
 * this.createElement("div");
 @public
 @hideconstructor

     * getter to specify their pawn type.
