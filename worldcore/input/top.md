The Worldcore input system is an optional part of Worldcore. It consists of a view-side service, the InputManager, which translates a wide range of standard DOM events into Croquet events. Both the model and the view can subscribe to these events, providing a simple mechanism for for routing user input through the reflector.

The InputMangager supports basic keyboard and pointer events, as well as resize, pointer lock, and fullscreen. It also generates events for derived inputs, such as chords (multiple keys pressed simultaneously), taps, swipe, double clicks, and zooms (on multitouch devices).
