Worldcore WebGL is a simple webGL renderer that sits on top of Worldcore. It is compatible with webGL 1.0 and most implementations of webGL 2.0. It provides simple utilities for the creation and rendering of triangular meshes. It supports a single ambient and directional light, as well as screen-space ambient occlusion for shadows.
