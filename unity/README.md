# Croquet-For-Unity Docs

The actual docs are in the croquet-for-unity-tutorials repo: https://github.com/croquet/croquet-for-unity-tutorials/

This repo has the doc generator and theme. It expects `croquet-for-unity-tutorials` to be checked out next to `croquet-docs`.


    ├── croquet-for-unity-tutorials
    │   └── docs

    └── croquet-docs

If that's in place, you can build the unity docs like any other using `npm run build` or `npm run watch` in this directory.
