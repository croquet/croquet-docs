Croquet Virtual DOM

The Croquet Virtual DOM is a high-level framework that extends the core capabilities of Croquet. It’s a set of tools for writing Croquet applications that use a browser’s DOM as multiuser interface elements.
Yoshiki Ohshima [gave a talk](https://youtu.be/kn8TZdgYMWc?t=286) on Croquet and the live programming functionality built into the Virtual DOM Framework. The talk was in Japanese but you can turn on the English subtitles.
